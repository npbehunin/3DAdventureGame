GENERAL
- Avoid any checks that deal with the player's forward and side directions and focus on dealing with velocity.
- Keep as close as possible!

FOLLOW STATE
- "If the pet is outside the walk radius, run towards the player directly."
- Do a slerp from the current move input towards the player.

"While the pet is inside the walk radius..."

RUNNING STATE
- Deviation is allowed.
- Always use a slerp from the current direction to the new one.
- Increase move speed if too far away and decrease if too close.

WALKING STATE
- "If the player's velocity is below x, set the speed to something low."
- "Otherwise, transition to running state."
- Deviate towards the player until close enough, then move straight with the player.
- Increase move speed if too far away and decrease if too close.

IDLE STATE
- Transition to idle if the player's velocity is below x and the pet is within the stop radius.
- Remain idle until the player reaches running speed OR gets too far away.
- Remain idle if directly in front of the player.

WARP STATE
- If the pet leaves the stable radius, teleport to the player's position.
- Make sure x amount of time passes before trying to teleport again.

OBSTACLE CHECKS
- If the player's velocity is above x AND there's an obstacle x distance away from the pet's velocity AND there's NO obstacle
	x distance away from the player's velocity, deviate towards the middle of the player.
- If there's a large drop that extends x height below the pet nearby (unclimbable) and the player's x height is within the pet's, then avoid deviating towards it.
- If there's a wall that extends x height next to the pet (unclimbable) then avoid deviating towards it.
