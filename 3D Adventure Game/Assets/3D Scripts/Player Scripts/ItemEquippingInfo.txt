NOTES ON EQUIPPING ITEMS AND INVENTORY
SCRIPTS (So far)
- Item (The specific item information)
- ItemDatabase (Contains all the items in the game)
- Inventory (Contains the collected items)
- EquipController (Handles equipping items/weapons)

ITEM INFORMATION
- Items will have information such as an id, "title", description, sellable, stats (with sub info such as damage, etc), etc.
- Each item will be given a "type" to determine what kind of an item it is. If it's a "weapon" type, we also choose a sub type like "sword", "bow", etc. If it's a "collectable", then it's automatically a "stackable" type.
- All the information will be stored in JSON.

INVENTORY
- The inventory will contain all the items the player collects throughout the game.
