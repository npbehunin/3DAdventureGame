	//The boss has 3 (4) attacks:
	//Starts...
	//Drops rocks from the ceiling (Stomps his foot, which can also hurt the player)
	//Summons rocks underneath the player
	//After two hits...
	//Summons 2 guardians alongside him.
	//Summons rocks and drops them more frequently.
	
	//In order to damage the boss, the player must use torches and burning wood that falls with the rocks to light the
	//arrows on fire and hit the boss's wood leg.
	//Once the leg has been hit 3 times, the boss will fall to the ground. The player must then wail on the boss to
	//finish the fight.
